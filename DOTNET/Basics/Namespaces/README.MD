Namespaces
.NET uses namespaces to organize its many classes,sturcts,interfaces,delegates,enums under a specific name.

The namespace keyword is used to declare a scope that contains a set of related objects. You can use a namespace to organize code elements and to create globally unique types.

A namespace is designed for providing a way to keep one set of names separate from another. The class names declared in one namespace does not conflict with the same class names declared in another.
