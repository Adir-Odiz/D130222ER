Exceptions practice
<hr/>
Create an application that recieves two user inputs , and display their division result
<br/>
In case one of the user inputs is not a number print "invalid input".
<br/>
In case the user tries to divide by zero print "Not allowed to divide by zero".
<br/>
*Use only try catch for achieving the user input validation , reflection
<br/>
*Don't use conditions or TryParse to validate the user input.
*Use System.DivideByZeroException , System.Exception types when handling the exceptions
