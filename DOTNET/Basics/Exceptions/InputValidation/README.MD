# Exceptions practice
Create an application that recieves two user inputs , and display their division result

1. In case one of the user inputs is not a number print "invalid input".
2. In case the user tries to divide by zero print "Not allowed to divide by zero".
* Use only try catch for achieving the user input validation , reflection
* Don't use conditions or TryParse to validate the user input.
* Use System.DivideByZeroException , System.Exception types when handling the exceptions
