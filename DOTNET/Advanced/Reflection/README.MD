# Reflection, Attributes 
Reflection, Attributes - Prodvide meta data to describe assemblies, modules, and types.

Is useful in the following situations:

* When you have to access attributes in your program's metadata. For more information, see Retrieving Information Stored in Attributes.
* For examining and instantiating types in an assembly.
* For building new types at run time. Use classes in System.Reflection.Emit.
* For performing late binding, accessing methods on types created at run time. See the topic Dynamically Loading and Using Types.
